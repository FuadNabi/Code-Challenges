You will be given an array of numbers as input. Insert the numbers (in order) one-at-a-time into a binary search tree. Then return a string with the tree in pre-order (You can use the pre-order function that you wrote in the previous lesson).


binarySearchTree([8, 3, 10, 1, 6, 14, 4, 7, 13])
// => "8 3 1 6 4 7 10 14 13"
